# State

## Persistent state on all servers:
*(Updated on stable storage before responding to RPCs)*

- **currentTerm**: Latest term server has seen (initialized to 0 on first boot, increases monotonically)
- **votedFor**: `candidateId` that received vote in current term (or null if none)
- **log[]**: Log entries; each entry contains command for state machine, and term when entry was received by leader (first index is 1)

## Volatile state on all servers:
- **commitIndex**: Index of highest log entry known to be committed (initialized to 0, increases monotonically)
- **lastApplied**: Index of highest log entry applied to state machine (initialized to 0, increases monotonically)

## Volatile state on leaders:
*(Reinitialized after election)*

- **nextIndex[]**: For each server, index of the next log entry to send to that server (initialized to leader last log index + 1)
- **matchIndex[]**: For each server, index of highest log entry known to be replicated on server (initialized to 0, increases monotonically)

# RequestVote RPC

*Invoked by candidates to gather votes (§5.2).*

## Arguments:
- **term**: Candidate’s term  
- **candidateId**: Candidate requesting vote  
- **lastLogIndex**: Index of candidate’s last log entry (§5.4)  
- **lastLogTerm**: Term of candidate’s last log entry (§5.4)  

## Results:
- **term**: `currentTerm`, for candidate to update itself  
- **voteGranted**: `true` means candidate received vote  

## Receiver implementation:
1. Reply `false` if `term < currentTerm` (§5.1)  
2. If `votedFor` is `null` or `candidateId`, and candidate’s log is at least as up-to-date as receiver’s log, grant vote (§5.2, §5.4)  


# AppendEntries RPC

*Invoked by leader to replicate log entries (§5.3); also used as heartbeat (§5.2).*

## Arguments:
- **term**: Leader’s term  
- **leaderId**: So follower can redirect clients  
- **prevLogIndex**: Index of log entry immediately preceding new ones  
- **prevLogTerm**: Term of `prevLogIndex` entry  
- **entries[]**: Log entries to store (empty for heartbeat; may send more than one for efficiency)  
- **leaderCommit**: Leader’s `commitIndex`  

## Results:
- **term**: `currentTerm`, for leader to update itself  
- **success**: `true` if follower contained entry matching `prevLogIndex` and `prevLogTerm`  

## Receiver implementation:
1. Reply `false` if `term < currentTerm` (§5.1)  
2. Reply `false` if log doesn’t contain an entry at `prevLogIndex` whose term matches `prevLogTerm` (§5.3)  
3. If an existing entry conflicts with a new one (same index but different terms), delete the existing entry and all that follow it (§5.3)  
4. Append any new entries not already in the log  
5. If `leaderCommit > commitIndex`, set `commitIndex = min(leaderCommit, index of last new entry)`  

# Rules for Servers

## All Servers:
- If `commitIndex > lastApplied`: increment `lastApplied`, apply `log[lastApplied]` to state machine (§5.3)  
- If RPC request or response contains term `T > currentTerm`: set `currentTerm = T`, convert to follower (§5.1)  

## Followers (§5.2):
- Respond to RPCs from candidates and leaders  
- If election timeout elapses without receiving `AppendEntries` RPC from current leader or granting vote to candidate: convert to candidate  

## Candidates (§5.2):
- On conversion to candidate, start election:  
  - Increment `currentTerm`  
  - Vote for self  
  - Reset election timer  
  - Send `RequestVote` RPCs to all other servers  
- If votes received from majority of servers: become leader  
- If `AppendEntries` RPC received from new leader: convert to follower  
- If election timeout elapses: start new election  

## Leaders:
- Upon election: send initial empty `AppendEntries` RPCs (heartbeat) to each server; repeat during idle periods to prevent election timeouts (§5.2)  
- If command received from client: append entry to local log, respond after entry applied to state machine (§5.3)  
- If last log index ≥ `nextIndex` for a follower: send `AppendEntries` RPC with log entries starting at `nextIndex`  
  - If successful: update `nextIndex` and `matchIndex` for follower (§5.3)  
  - If `AppendEntries` fails because of log inconsistency: decrement `nextIndex` and retry (§5.3)  
- If there exists an `N` such that `N > commitIndex`, a majority of `matchIndex[i] ≥ N`, and `log[N].term == currentTerm`: set `commitIndex = N` (§5.3, §5.4).
